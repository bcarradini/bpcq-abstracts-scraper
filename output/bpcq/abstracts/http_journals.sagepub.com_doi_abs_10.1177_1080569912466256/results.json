      "The ability to communicate effectively remains a critical skill for obtaining a job and achieving success in the workplace; however, many still lack these skills. In particular, graduates lack adequate writing skills. This article advocates the use of problem-based scenarios to teach writing, which focuses on authentic rhetorical framing similar to writing done in the workplace. A sample scenario is provided along with three responses, showing the type of issues involved in helping students develop writing skills appropriate to an organizational context."
