      "Faced with shrinking budgets and changing standards at their colleges and universities, instructors of business communication are looking for new ways to prepare stu dents for careers in business. Using computer-mediated technologies, instructors can develop activities outside the classroom to motivate and inform students. Augmenting business communication courses with e-mail and Internet protocols, instructors can reach larger segments of their classes, stimulate discussions, create simulations, and strengthen their relationships with students. Using imagi native techniques, students and instructors can work together to develop a new kind of educational community whose communications are mediated by computers."
