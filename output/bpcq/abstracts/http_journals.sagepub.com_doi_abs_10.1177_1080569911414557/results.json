      "Authentic reflections are critical components of strong portfolios, and students often struggle with this important task. Students in our program have found success through carefully constructed steps of collecting, selecting, and reflecting on artifacts from their coursework, internships, and extracurricular activities. Working in peer groups as well as meeting individually with the instructor are key parts of the entire process."
