      "Just as the challenge in a global economy is to develop new frameworks and then communicate them effectively, our challenge is to prepare students for negotiating wholly new communication challenges. Communication is much more than expressing the content of other \"real\" business disciplines clearly. Language and image have become a crucial part of creating and managing contemporary corporate culture; thus, we must expand the teaching of man agerial communication to include corporate communication. To describe \"communication,\" we must also employ words such as \"critical thinking\" and \"flexibility.\" Communication is integral to the process of problem solving in the team-oriented workplace."
