      "The global business community makes understanding cultural differences importantfor business communication students, ourfuture managers and negotiators. But discussions of cultural diversity or multiculturalism should not be limited to cultures of a foreign country only. They should also include an understanding of the diversity within one culture. This article discusses several terms used to denote cultural diversity and their implications and then provides assignments that give students experience in researching various aspects of \"culture,\" in exploring issues of cultural diversity, and in producing appropriate documents."
