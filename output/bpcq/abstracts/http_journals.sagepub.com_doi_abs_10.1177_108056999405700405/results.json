      "A review of business communication textbooks was con ducted to determine, according to the textbook authors, what information should and should not be included on the résumé, the format, and the importance of the overall appearance. Although the research shows there is agree ment among the textbook authors on many issues, there is also disagreement in several areas. But the message is clear—with the increasing competition in the employment market, college graduates would be well advised to develop a résumé that is complete, concise, clear, and error-free."
