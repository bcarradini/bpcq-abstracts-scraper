      "The Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) was designed to serve two purposes: assess appli cants' ability to think critically and communicate complex ideas and aid MBA programs in diagnosing any deficiencies in accepted candidates in order to place them in appropriate classes. To determine how programs are using the AWA scores, we surveyed the 121 member schools of the Graduate Manage ment Council. Eighty-six percent of the fifty-nine respondents indicated that they do indeed use the scores to refine their admissions decisions, but only a few schools use the test diagnostically in making such other decisions as plac ing students in writing development courses, waving communication require ments, or granting assistantships."
