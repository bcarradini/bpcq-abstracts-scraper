      "As collaborative or team-based projects become more popular in both secondary and post-secondary classrooms, instructors are looking for ways for group mem bers to effectively evaluate one another. Constructing effective evaluation tools can be a daunting task. As shown by a review of literature, best practices include (1) building a foundation in the classroom that supports collaborative evaluation, (2) creating effective evaluation tools by articulating specific criteria and ensuring honest student participation (3) implementing formative feedback during the col laborative experience, (4) formulating summative feedback at the conclusion of the experience, and (5) assessing the collaborative evaluation process."
