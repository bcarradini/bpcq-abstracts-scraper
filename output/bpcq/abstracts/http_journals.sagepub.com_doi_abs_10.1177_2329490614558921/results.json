      "We examined how 106 early-career professionals constructed video change messages involving a ban on remote working. These professionals constructed three types of statements: vision statements, direct change statements, and indirect change statements. Professionals with higher assertive-directing motivational values tended to first construct vision statements and secondly construct direct change statements, whereas professionals higher in analytic-autonomizing motivational values tended to first construct indirect change statements and secondly construct direct change statements. Overall, early-career professionals displayed strong group orientation in their rationale for change and low directness in communicating change."
