      "Applying an international framework of work-related values, we offer practical suggestions for improving the effectiveness of training initiatives directed at Mexican- Americans. Specifically, it is recommended that those who train workers of Mexican descent (a) emphasize considerate behavior, (b) use encouragement techniques, (c) avoid public confrontation, (d) maintain a respectful distance with trainees, (e) foster participation, (f) offer collaborative team projects, (g) inspire ongoing education, (h) formally recog nize program completion, (i) allow ample time for topic coverage, (j) be sensitive to the status of women, (k) avoid blaming students for training failures, (l) settle conflicts amicably, and (m) provide guidance and structure for the participants. Since productive organizations must assume the responsibility for training employees when the prepara tory education system fails, implications for universities serving Mexican-American populations are also offered."
