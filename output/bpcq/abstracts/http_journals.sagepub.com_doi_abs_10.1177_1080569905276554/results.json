      "UCLAâ€™s program in strategic management for European corporate communication professionals provides participants with a concentrated, yet selective, immersion in those management disciplines taught at U.S. business schools, topics that are essential to their work as senior advisors to CEOs and as leaders in the field. The choice of topics represents the close collaboration between the directors of the UCLA and Lugano programs. The UCLA program also encourages the active participation of the professionals by offering an exposure to teaching and classroom communication practices of U.S. business schools that adhere to the case approach to business education and by providing numerous opportunities for participants to present their analyses and application of management topics to their professional roles and responsibilities. Working with European professionals also enables U.S. faculty to reconsider some of their own assumptions about teaching as they train U.S.-based MBA students."
