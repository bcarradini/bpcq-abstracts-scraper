      "Understanding the globalization of business practices is an important area of learning for students studying in master of business administration (MBA) programs today, and many graduate business programs offer study tour programs for experiential learning. This article examines the instructional design of one program and makes recommendations for how to place greater emphasis on intercultural learning in conjunction with business learning. A description of student learning through presurveys and postsurveys, as well as reflections through term papers, is explored."
