      "To aid in selecting employees, recruiters use such tools as the interview, resume, academic portfolio, and videos. However, these tools are not equally effective in helping job candidates showcase specific skills during the hiring process. In a survey, we asked recruiters about the skills they seek in applicants and the best method for students to demonstrate those skills. The top five skills sought, not unexpectedly, are 1: communication (oral and written); 2. computer literacy; 3. interpersonal/social; 4. critical thinking/leadership (tied); and 5. teamwork. Recruiters still favored the resume and interview as methods for demonstrating these skills, but they also felt a portfolio was useful in providing evidence of these skills in context. None recommended video presentation. Based on this study, we suggest that instructors provide students with explicit instruction on developing resumes and portfolios and in performing well in interviews."
