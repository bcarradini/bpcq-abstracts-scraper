      "Academic Service-Learning (AS-L) is an innovative business communication pedagogy. Like community service, AS-L involves students volunteering in the community; however, AS-L requires the infusion of the classroom content into the community service experience. This article describes AS-L, the assignment for a business communication class, and students' reactions as well as benefits and challenges to its use. The greatest strength of using AS-L is students'tying theory into actual application of principles, student passion for the work, fac ulty enthusiasm for the results, and community satisfaction."
