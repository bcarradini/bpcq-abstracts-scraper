      "This study assesses communication training provided in MBA and executive MBA programs in Singapore. The authors found that Singapore is a microcosm in terms of (a) requirements for English competency, (b) the variety of communication offerings, and (c) the lack of uniformity in the delivery of communication training. Whereas Singaporean MBA/EMBA programs sit in a highly internationalized environment with substantial foreign student intake, and whereas Singapore is known for adopting best practices in education from around the world, communication training for management evidences a veneer of Asian content and imitation rather than innovation. These findings caused the authors to rethink what they have traditionally regarded as management communication and to consider the need for further internationalization, not only in this multicultural city-state but worldwide."
