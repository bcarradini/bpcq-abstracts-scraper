With Kolb's experiential learning model as a theoretical base, the self-assessment questionnaire in the exercise was developed on the basis of seven. dimensions of communication compe tence identified and confirmed by various empirical studies as predictors of intercultural business success. After com pleting this exercise, students should be able to (a) identify their communication behavior in intercultural interactions, (b) be aware of their communication competence level in intercultural interactions, and (c) increase their under standing of the relationship between communication behav ior and intercultural business management success."
