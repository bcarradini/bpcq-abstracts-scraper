      "Given that students are enthusiastic about social media or even have expertise in some social media tools, the author decided to design a class project in her Writing for Careers (Business Communication) class that integrates social media in terms of content and project management. This article intends to describe such a class project design as well as the working process; reflect on such a practice by reviewing studentsâ€™ feedback, examining the final products, and assessing the learning outcomes; and finally provide suggestions on how to improve this project."
