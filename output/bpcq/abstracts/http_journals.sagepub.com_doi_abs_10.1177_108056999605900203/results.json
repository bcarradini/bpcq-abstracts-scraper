      "A survey of syllabi of MBA communication courses suggests that the \"typi cal\" MBA course focuses on skill development and integrates both speaking and writing, often with emphasis on speech. It builds problem solving and strategic communication skills through experiential learning gained in work shops, case studies, or field experiences. Current trends favor integration of communication courses into a unified core."
