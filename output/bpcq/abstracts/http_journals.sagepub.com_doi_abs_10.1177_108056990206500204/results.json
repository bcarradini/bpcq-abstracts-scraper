      "As researchers, we often overstate the distinction between our own specialties and those fields that are clearly related. thus dismissing or ignoring research outside our specialties. Similarly, we too often fragment our teaching to focus on particular communication processes and competencies that fit our notions of what is appro priate for our chosen subdisciplines. Such fragmentation, however, diminishes our teaching and research. To overcome this problem, we should work toward struc tural realignments in our universities to encourage cross-disciplinary work; design majors around competencies, not departments; encourage coteaching to focus dif ferent perspectives on one case or example; encourage interdepartmental \"commu nication dialogues\"; read a broad range of literature and work toward expertise in a topic, not just a discipline; attend other than just the usual conferences; and invite students to use a wide range of resources in solving problems."
