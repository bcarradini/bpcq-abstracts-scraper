      "We describe a model organization tree for the typical report expected of stu , dents in the strategy or policy course almost universally required in business programs, whether undergraduate or graduate. By defining the relationships between the various analytical tasks and the overall strategy recommendation, the model helps students not only organize the final report but also under stand the process by which they are to arrive at a strategy recommendation."
