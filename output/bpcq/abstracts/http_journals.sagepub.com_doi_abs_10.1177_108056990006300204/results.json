      "As a result of a major revision of the undergraduate curriculum in the Darla Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina, we were given the task of establishing a center for business communication. Based on this experience, we present our strategic consultancy model for launching such a center. The model employs the strategic management paradigm of identifying the principle players in the process; identifying stakeholders; defining goals; analyzing strengths, weak nesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis); establishing consultancy relationships; and evaluating results. The model proved successful in writing a proposal for the center, implementing the center, and evaluating the center's work."
