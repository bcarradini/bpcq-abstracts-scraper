      "In 1995, Elmhurst College began developing a new major in Human Services Administration to serve the needs of a burgeoning adult student population. It is an accelerated, interdisciplinary program in which a small cohort of stu dents matriculates as an interdependent group throughout their college work. Students begin the program with a five-week communication module that pre pares them to communicate information, coordinate activities, and make deci sions. The module includes five components: intercultural communication, the process and contexts of communication, relationship development and self- disclosure, group communication and team building, and oral communica tion. These components were selected as the most important topics to be covered in a short time frame. Teachers serve largely as coaches or guides, lead ing students through exercises in active and cooperative learning, especially those exercises that build listening skills, the fundamental skills for all commu nication."
