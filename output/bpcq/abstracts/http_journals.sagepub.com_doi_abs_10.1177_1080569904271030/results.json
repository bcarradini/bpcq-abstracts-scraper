      "In their study of 261 students enrolled in eight sections of a business communication course, three taught in a traditional classroom setting and the others delivered in a hybrid, half-time online format, the authors found that all students measurably improved their writing skills. On another dimension of interest, however, students in the online hybrid course demonstrated a higher rate of active learning practices in their use of Blackboard course management software. Perhaps most important, online writing instruction yielded as significant levels of measurable improvement in writing as did instruction in a traditional classroom, provided that instructional materials corresponded to the particular needs of the students. These results are encouraging in indicating that online courses may provide the best form of course delivery for certain students and certain communication practices."
