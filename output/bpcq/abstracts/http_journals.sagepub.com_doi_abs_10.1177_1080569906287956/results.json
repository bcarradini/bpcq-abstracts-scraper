      "This article examines the teaching of résumé writing at one university in Russia and several institutions in the Newly Independent States (NIS). The authors explore challenges including variable cultural norms for written versus oral communication, severe financial and material hardship in the educational sector, cultural discomfort with the norms of U.S. business writing, issues related to the transition from Soviet-style socialism to Western-style capitalism, and other historical factors that shape expectations for business communication in Russia and the NIS. Recommendations to business writing and communication faculty conclude the article."
