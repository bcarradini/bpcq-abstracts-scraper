      "The effectiveness of WordPerfect's Grammatik as a tool for business writing is the sub ject of this study. Results of this informal study suggest significant limitations to the effectiveness of this application as a guide for student writ ers. I reached this conclusion by having 12 students' papers critiqued by both Grammatik (affectionately known as Gramma) and by real English/ business communication professors to compare their values."
