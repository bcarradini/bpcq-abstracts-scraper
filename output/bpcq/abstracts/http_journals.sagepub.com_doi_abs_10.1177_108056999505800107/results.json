      "The diversity of society today requires people to interact with others who have different cultural backgrounds. The simplest communication can be complicated by nonverbal factors. This study used a pretest-posttest design to deter mine the effect of an intervention treatment consisting of students viewing pictures of people and identifying attrib utes based solely on what they see. Then in groups the students discussed their varying interpretations. The findings were that the treatment made students more aware of nonverbal factors and how they are involved in interper sonal communication."
