      "Educators need to be more proactive in expanding course offerings to respond to the academic needs of university students. Draum by excellent pay and prospects of gaining valuable experience, more college graduates are pursuing employment in consulting. With consulting skills growing in importance for many of our students in the 21st century, business communication scholars are particularly well posi tioned to help students develop these requisite skills and knowledge. Offering a course dedicated to the topic of consulting, or including consulting experience in a standard business communication course prepares students for engaging in consult ing activities, including research, assessment, training and development, facilita tion, and evaluation. Our course foregrounds instructional frameworks and serv ice learning to assist students in systematically assessing organizational problems and designing and implementing organizational interventions."
