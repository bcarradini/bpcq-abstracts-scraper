      "This article advocates student learning portfolios as an effective assessment technique and explains how instructors and administrators can devise a process that involves community partners in assessing student performance. Having community experts judge a student portfolio contest helps faculty identify standards for success that can inform decision making about course content and program offerings. The article discusses how to gain and sustain community involvement in program assessment and describes how portfolio assessment led to the creation of a technical and business writing advisory board at an urban university."
