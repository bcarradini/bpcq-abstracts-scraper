      "For years, students, faculty, and, most important, employers, have recognized the need for improved communication skills. The university business communication curriculum is filled with topics that lead to improving communication skills. A per centage of students find some topics to be boring, unimportant, intimidating, and/or nonessential. However, other students find these same topics to be interest ing, significant, challenging, and vital. For example, college students fear giving oral presentations more than writing papers. Could the preference or the abhor rence of various business communication topics be related to personality type? To answer this question, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), combined with a Likert Scale, was used to study the relationship between business communication students' personality types and their preferred topics in business communication."
