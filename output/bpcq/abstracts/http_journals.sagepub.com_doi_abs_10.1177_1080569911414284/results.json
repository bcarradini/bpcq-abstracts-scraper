      "While experts agree the U.S. recession is over, many employees feel that they are still being asked to do more work for less pay. This concept of less compensation for employees is not surprising, but no one has addressed how volunteers in organizations might also be affected by the economy. Are volunteers also expected to do more work for (literally) no monetary compensation? This case study explains how the duties asked of hospital volunteers are evolving and ends with a discussion of ethics relating to the volunteer descriptions used at a not-for-profit organization."
