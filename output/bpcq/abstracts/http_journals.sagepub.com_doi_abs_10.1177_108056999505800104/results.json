      "This paper describes a project incorporating writing-to- learn activities into an introductory finance class. Such activities use writing informally as a vehicle to promote student learning. Examination of the students' brief papers showed that students became less likely to skip theory and go to canned formulas and that they took more responsibil ity for their work. For instructors, the project was beneficial because it enabled them to tailor class presentations more precisely to students' actual comprehension of course material."
