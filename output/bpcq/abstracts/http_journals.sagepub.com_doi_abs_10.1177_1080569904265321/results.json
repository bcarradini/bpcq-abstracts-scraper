      "Client projects are an opportunity for universities to create long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with businesses through an academic consultancy service. This article discusses the rationale and logistics of two models for conducting such projects. One model, used at Clemson University, is a formal academic consultancy service in which students are paid for their work with for-profit businesses. Another, used at the University of North Texas, also incorporates for-profit clients but operates in the more traditional classroom setting where student teams are not paid for their work. Whatever the approach, client projects facilitate communication between academia and business, enlist the services of professionals in a variety of fields to help shape the education of future graduates, offer opportunities for students to gain practical experience that surpasses any classroom simulation or case study, and keep instructors in touch with business trends and practices."
