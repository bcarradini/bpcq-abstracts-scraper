      "Traditionally, research about collaboration in business communication classes has focused on small-group interaction and peer review of documents. Yet, computer classrooms and electronic networks used for teaching business communication today are affecting how traditional collaboration works and are opening up new possibilities for collaborative activity. One exciting possibility is using network technology to promote collaboration beyond the four walls of a single classroom. This article outlines a model for distance collaboration between business writing classrooms using network technology and discusses new ways to teach national and international audience awareness, problem solving, and the contextual nature of cases."
