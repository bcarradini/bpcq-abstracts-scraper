      "Social media offers an exciting new area for our discipline to produce research and pedagogy that is in high demand by students, industry constituents, and other disciplines. This article discusses why business communication scholars should focus on social media as an important stream of study and outlines an MBA course in social media strategy currently in development from a business communication perspective. The author challenges the discipline to create social media content from an integrated communication approach."
