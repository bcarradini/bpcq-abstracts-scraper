      "The inclusion of cases and simulations in our curricula may reflect a funda mental paradigm shift in American higher education. Now, colleges must do more than instruct; they must also prove that learning takes place. While the movement toward experiential learning has grown, surprisingly little mention has been made in the literature of the need to ground the use of cases and simulations in experiential learning theory. A basic understanding of the experiential learning process and the nature of cases and simulations as expe riential activities will help instructors of business communication develop, evaluate, and use these tools more effectively."
