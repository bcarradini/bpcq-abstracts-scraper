      "English language business-related documents around the world contain purposeful spelling differences that reflect two standards, American English and British English. Given the importance of culturally acceptable spelling, the need to be aware of and sensitive to cultural differences, and strong reactions to variation in spelling, it is important to understand the differences in these two spelling systems. Families of words that illustrate spelling practices draw attention to differences between the American and British spelling systems. Under at least some circumstances, business communicators should accommodate for spelling differences when communicating with those from other cultures. Implementing the presented teaching ideas based upon reacting, discussing, adapting, researching, and writing can clarify understanding of the American and British business-related spelling systems and help learners to prepare more culturally sensitive business documents when appropriate."
