      "In this potentially controversial article, the author expresses grave concerns about Grammatik 5 for Win dows, both as a teaching tool and as a subtle means of propagating a political perspective. His objections to the software are on four grounds: lexicological, grammatical, structural, and political. The software presents users with feedback that is often wrong, frequently confusing, and sometimes irrelevant. Of particular interest is his discov ery that Grammatik 5 has been programmed to encourage \"political correctness.\""
