      "Management students need to learn both analytic and communication skills to be successful in the university and at work. Communicative methods used to teach English as a Second Language (ESL), such as collaborative learning, dialogue journals, peer review, and oral presentations, can be adapted readily to teaching analytical and communication skills to native and nonnative speakers of English. ESL strategies work well to enable learners to analyze readings and form and communicate well-developed opinions in the context of case studies and media critiques used in business communication."
