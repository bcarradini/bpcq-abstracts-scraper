      "Marketing educators have long recognized the need for strengthening their students' business communication skills. Recruiters routinely consider superior communica tions skills as essential hiring criteria when filling entry- level marketing positions. Additionally, marketing students consistently rate communication-intensive business courses as among those most helpful to them in preparing for their business careers. This paper discusses an undergraduate buyer-behavior course project targeted at improving stu dents' business communication skills through a team- teaching project. The paper highlights the value of integrating written, oral, and electronic communications pedagogy with buyer-behavior course instruction and then outlines the project from a \"how-to-do-it\" perspective."
