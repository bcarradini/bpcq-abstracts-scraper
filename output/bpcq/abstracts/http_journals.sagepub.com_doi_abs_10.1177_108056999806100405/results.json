      "Increasing numbers of Association for Business Communication members are using multimedia as a form of instruction. Because copyright guidelines affecting multimedia production have only recently been established, policies are not well known. To determine if ABC members understand the guidelines, we created a questionnaire about specific instances of multimedia use and sent it via Internet e-mail to a sample chosen from the 1996 membership directory. Respondents received an average grade of \"C,\" with most answering conservatively, assuming that copyright restrictions are more restrictive than they, in fact, are."
