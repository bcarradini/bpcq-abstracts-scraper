      "A study of 32 top-ranked MBA programs suggests that management communica tion is an important part of professional graduate management education. Eigh teen of the schools have required core courses in communication, and two other schools follow an integrated model and also offer electives; another nine offer elec tives only. A total of four schools also have writing proficiency requirements, and all four of those schools have core communication courses as well. Only three schools in the sample do not have any communication course offerings. These results are based on an analysis of official Websites and follow-up contact by e- mail or personal interview."
