      "We assert that schools and textbook publishers ineffectively emphasize gram mar. To see if traditional instruction in grammar prepares students for busi ness communication classes and the corporate world, we investigated specific writing skills of both native and nonnative business students. Although most students passed objective grammar and punctuation tests—the two groups showed no statistical differences—some cannot write. High schools, the study found, pass these students. The university also passes writing-deficient stu dents on to employers who must train them. We searched for reasonable solu tions to reduce the number of graduates who lack English skills for the workplace."
