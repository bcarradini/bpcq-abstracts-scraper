      "An innovative course in fundamentals of management communication derives from competency-based instruction. Course designers created a list of competen cies and behavioral objectives for each of four modules: business writing funda mentals, formal report writing, informative oral presentations, and persuasive oral presentations. Students receive the list before instructions. Students also gain instruction in class or through self-study or both. They are assessed through multi ple forms of assessment, and those assessments are measured in relation to individ ual demonstration of competencies rather than course norms. In general, the stu dents, faculty, and administration have viewed this course positively."
