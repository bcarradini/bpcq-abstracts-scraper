      "Many business researchers today are puzzled when they attempt to construct electronic references to cite sources used in their writing. The most recent edi tions of both the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Associa tion and the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers were published before today's most widely used Internet protocols were introduced: This arti cle presents APA and MLA guides for formatting electronic references.
