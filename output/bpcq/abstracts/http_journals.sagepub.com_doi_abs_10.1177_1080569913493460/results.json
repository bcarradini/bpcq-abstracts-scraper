      "The increasing availability of recording technologies makes it easier to include usability testing projects in business communication courses. Usability testing is a method of discovering whether people can navigate, read, and understand a print or electronic communication well enough to achieve a particular purpose in a reasonable time frame. Usability projects increase students’ knowledge and motivation by forcing them to experience the audience’s frustrations with poorly written and designed communications. By following the suggestions and examples provided, faculty can develop effective usability project materials and capitalize on new technologies for data collection and sharing."
