      "Research on leadership and teams suggests that men and women exhibit different leadership and interpersonal communication styles. A review of literature and a survey of students in upper-level business communication courses at Central Mis souri State University provide evidence for five strategies to assist students in deal ing with team-interaction situations:1. Instruct students in techniques to avoid groupthink and to promote and handle competition2. Offer students ideas on and methods for reaching agreement in a timely manner3. Vary the subject of group writing assignments to allow each student to be per ceived as an expert4. Encourage all students to be active participants in the group process5. Emphasize the importance of good writing skills to both males and femalesFinally, further research is needed regarding the \"natural leader\" role, the role of competition in groups, and the effect of perceptions of tasks as either \"feminine\" or \"masculine.\""
