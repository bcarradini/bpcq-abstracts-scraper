      "As a topic within the larger corpus of materials on selection interviewing, applicant appearance has been addressed through advice giving, folk wisdom, and other prescrip tions. As presented, such materials tend to undermine opportunities for issue identification and assessment. Through review and interpretation of that employment interview research which addresses the relationship between applicant appearance and interviewer selection decisions, the purpose of this paper is to encourage those who teach, train, and counsel others on employment inter viewing to devote more studied attention to appearance issues and ethics. To that end, five instructional proposi tions are offered. Each proposition is developed through review of related research and then capped by instructional observations."
