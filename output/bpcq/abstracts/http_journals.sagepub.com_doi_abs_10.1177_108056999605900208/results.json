      "This article describes a communication audit project used in a graduate-level management communication course. We review some of the literature con cerning communication audits, explain why and how we use an audit in our classes, and describe specific audit-related assignments. While a challenging assignment both for student and professor, the audit is—in our judgment— clearly worth the effort."
