      "This article examines how the levels of student interaction change through the use of small groups and moderators in online writing courses. The study examines three technical and professional online writing courses: one course that employs small groups and group moderators and two courses that have no small groups or moderators. The results of this study show that the amount of interaction between students in online writing courses increases dramatically by incorporating small groups and peer moderators."
