      "The presented merger and acquisition classroom exercise is based on a real yet incomplete transaction transpiring during the period of the class. The approach enables adult students to apply their previously acquired business experience to a strategic analysis project facilitating the development of group communication, critical thinking, and consensus-building competences. The exercise assumes that students have practical experience in business areas such as marketing or accounting before entering the classroom, which may make it less applicable to conventional-age students."
