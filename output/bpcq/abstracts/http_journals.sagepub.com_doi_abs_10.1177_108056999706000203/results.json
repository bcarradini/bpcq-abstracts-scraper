      "Forpractitioners and teachers, this article reviews the literature on differences in cultural assumptions underlying negotiation between businesspersons in the People's Republic of China and those from the West, particularly the United States. Unless perceived and understood, profound differences in atti tudes, expectations, and unworded messages will frustrate businesspeople's efforts to do business with China, a huge and developing market."
