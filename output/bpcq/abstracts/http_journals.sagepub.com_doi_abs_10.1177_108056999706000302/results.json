      "The importance of being fluent in a foreign language has been well docu mented and highlighted in academic texts. So has the importance of being fluent in another culture, a need documented as early as the 1950s. How have organizations in the UK and Ireland responded to these needs?A survey of members of ALECS (Association of Language Excellence Centres) in the UK and language training providers in Ireland assessed the level of language and cultural awareness. The results indicate that the percentage of British and Irish companies carrying out an internal foreign language audit is disturb ingly low. The number of companies wishing to become culturally fluent is even lower. Companies as well as training organizations are thus overlooking a number of opportunities."
