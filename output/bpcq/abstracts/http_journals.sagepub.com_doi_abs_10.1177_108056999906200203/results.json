      "With writing skills receiving increased emphasis in the accounting curriculum, edu cators need to explore the potential barriers to writing that students may experience. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether accounting majors have higher levels of writing apprehension than students in other majors. Also stud ied was whether gender, age, and grades in Freshman Composition were related to the level of writing anxiety. A sample of students responded to items on the Writing Apprehension Test to measure their writing apprehension. The students also identi fied their gender, age, major, and grades in Freshman Composition.Significant differences do exist in level of writing apprehension based on grades in Freshman Composition but not based on a student's age or gender choice. Most important, accounting majors did show significantly greater appre hension than non-accounting majors."
