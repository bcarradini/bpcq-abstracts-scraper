      "This article describes the development of a communication course for graduate business students that recognizes the emergence of global commerce using high-technology communication, while not ignoring fundamental skills. A \"diagnostic assessment center\" activity measures student abilities at the start of the course and again at the end. Oral and written skill-building and instruction in technologi cally mediated and intercultural communication are features of the course. The course was offered on an experi mental basis, and student progress and reactions to the course were carefully monitored. I explain the rationale behind the course content, evaluate the results, and offer advice to other schools designing such a course."
