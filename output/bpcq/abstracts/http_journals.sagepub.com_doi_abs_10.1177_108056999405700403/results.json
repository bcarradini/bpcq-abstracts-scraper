      "The purpose of this study was to determine if a unit on listening that consumes little class time would signifi cantly increase listening skills. This research design was basically pretest/treatment/posttest. Excluding the pre- and posttest, the treatment takes only 80 classroom min utes. The Watson-Barker Listening Test—Video Version was used as the measurement instrument. The data revealed that the average listening skills of participants increased over 21 %. The greatest improvement (over 40%) took place in two listening skill areas—evaluating mes sage content and understanding meaning in conuersation. A significant improvement (over 20%) occurred in under standing and remembering lectures."
