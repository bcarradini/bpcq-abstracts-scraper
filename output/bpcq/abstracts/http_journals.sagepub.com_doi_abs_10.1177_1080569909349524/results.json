      "This study examines the current status of the introductory business communication course at colleges and universities across the United States. Using data collected during the spring of 2008 from a national sample of 505 instructors, this study reveals a number of pedagogical and programmatic insights about (1) major course sponsors; (2) academic levels at which the course is taught; (3) instructorsâ€™ ideal and actual class sizes; (4) use of distance learning; (5) content coverage; and (6) required learning assignments. Findings from this study are compared with results from previous audits. Future research ideas as well as implications for business communication education are presented."
