      "In the global marketplace, professionals need to understand how cultural differences affect the writing and reading of business letters. Business commu nication courses can prepare students to meet this need by teaching students an effective, systematic method for analyzing the letters of the global economy. The method incorporates such characteristics as format, organization, rhetori cal strategies (ethos, pathos, logos), style, and writer's purpose. Through case studies in letter writing and analysis, students apply key communication prin ciples in an international context."
