      "Since Britons historically have placed a high value on the use of correct fortns of address, those who write to and speak with them should be familiar with their generally accepted address-related customs. In relatively formal commu nication settings, the use of titles and surnames is generally sanctioned, although there are some notable exceptions. In relatively informal communi cation settings, the use of first names or appropriate substitute expressions is generally sanctioned. Business communication teachers can incorporate infor mation about British forms of address into both general business communica tion and specialized international business communication courses as the provided examples suggest."
