      "While business writing textbooks generally do an adequatejob of helping instructors introduce real-life challenges into the classroom, there are at least two that they tend to slight or overlook. One is an encounter with a hostile, closed-minded audience, and the other is an extended conflict. An exercise that provides students with the practice they need in dealing with both of these challenges is described. Also, the method of grading the exercise is outlined, and the exercise's benefits are listed."
