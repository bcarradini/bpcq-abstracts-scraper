      "This study attempted to determine student perceptions of the value of using a prewriting problem-solving plan and its relationship to their success in writ ing. The business communication students in the study felt that the plan was beneficial, particularly for persuasive messages, individual writing, and small- group writing. In addition, participants seemed to feel that the plan was worth preparing even when not required as part of the assignment. The results sug gest that the problern-solving plan can be a useful tool for complicated assign ments and group work but that it should probably be optional for simple assignments."
