      "In an unusual cross-cultural endeavor, American and Russian students engaged in service learning as part of an organizational communication class in which they applied their skills to assist non-profit organizations. American students worked with a nursing home to plan a public relations event and the Russian students gave a party for children at an orphanage in Tomsk, Russia.Students worked in teams and accomplished assigned responsibilities. Both groups produced a public relations event and each contacted the press seeking news cover age. The Americans surveyed stakeholders about the effectiveness of the organiza tion's ability to communicate with its constituents. The Russians went about their project differently (they participated in the course online) ."
