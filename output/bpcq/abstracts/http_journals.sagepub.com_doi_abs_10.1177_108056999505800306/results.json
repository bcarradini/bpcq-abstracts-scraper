      "This four-year exploratory study was designed to investigate whether augmenting written comments on students' busi ness writing assignments with audiotaped remarks would lead to improved feedback, context, and performance; save time; and motivate student writers. The results showed that all factors improved except time, which could not be com pared directly to the results of previous studies."
