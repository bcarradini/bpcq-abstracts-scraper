      "The affective responses of readers to job-refusal letters using direct and indirect approaches were investigated. Subjects were requested to rate organizational plan on 19 dependent measures. Results indicated that the direct job-refusal letter was preferred. It was viewed as more efficient, valuable and straightforward than the indirect approach. These findings are in conflict with current literature favoring the indirect approach for conveying negative information."
