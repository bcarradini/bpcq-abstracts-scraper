      "As an alternative approach to web preproduction, I propose the use of concept maps for invention of website projects in business and professional writing courses. This mapping device approximates our studentsâ€™ initial site plans since rough ideas are formed based on a substantial exploratory technique. Incorporated in various disciplines, the construction of concept maps leads to better flowcharts and more structured wireframes for web development."
