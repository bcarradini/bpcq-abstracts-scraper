      "Most communication research on bad news messages focuses on crisis communication, where attention is often limited to image repair strategies. The authors argue that a key indicator of an organization’s effectiveness in communicating “bad news” messages is its organizational culture. Developing an organizational culture that values positive organizational behavior can transform the way that “bad news” messages are crafted and received in the workplace. In this article, the authors demonstrate how organizational leadership and practice from the positive organizational behavior perspective can assist with communicating “bad news” messages, particularly during organizational crises."
