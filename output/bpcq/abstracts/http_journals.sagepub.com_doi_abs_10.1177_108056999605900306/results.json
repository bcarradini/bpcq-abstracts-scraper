      "Defining \"writing well\" is a matter of critical importance. We in ABC announce to the academic community and the public that we help students acquire skills they need to \"write well\" once they leave our campuses. Yet we have not reached consensus on what it means to write business correspon dence well. This article explores the concept of writing well, based on an exchange of opinions on the BIZCOM listserv on the Internet. It also illus trates the influence of electronic mediation on the communication process. We offer it here with the hope of encouraging further discussion of both topics: writing well and electronic mediation."
