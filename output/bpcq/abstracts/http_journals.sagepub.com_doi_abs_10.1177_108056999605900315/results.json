      "To make the technical communication program at SUNY Institute of Technol ogy at Utica/Rome successful and to give students an advantage of working with practicing professionals, the faculty thought it wise to add an advisory board composed of professionals, managers, and others associated with profes sional and technical communication. This paper describes the program, the board's contributions, and the benefits received by the students, the program, and the board members themselves."
