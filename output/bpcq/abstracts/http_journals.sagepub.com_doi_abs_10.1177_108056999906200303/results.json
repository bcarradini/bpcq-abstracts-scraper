      "Outdoor challenge education has gained a dedicated following since its inception in the 1940s. Outdoor programs provide a framework for organizations to improve teamwork, problem solving, risk-taking, self-esteem, and interpersonal communi cation. The advantages of outdoor-based programs include high participation in learning by trainees, opportunity to experience real emotions and adopt new pat terns of thinking, ability to promote experimentation in problem solving, and pro motion of group awareness and trust. Many advantages of outdoor education can be maintained when a program goes indoors. Indoor adaptations are safe and nondiscriminatory; they can be conducted anywhere regardless of weather, can facilitate easier transfer of learning to the workplace, and are less expensive. Using the outdoor model, teachers can devise challenge activities for classroom use. Such activities provide variety and the opportunity for experiential learning in the busi ness communication classroom."
