      "There is little question among educators and business executives that excellent communication skills are requisites for today's jobs. Yet most business teachers realize the difficulty of getting students to take business communication courses seriously. Succcessful teachers know that students learn best when they value what they are learning as relevant. Teachers can often create learning environments that stimulate students' enthusiasm for learning if they can relate topics taught in school to career or life goals of students. This study was conducted to assist students in becoming more aware of business communica tion tasks they will be expected to complete when they enter the business world. The goal is to provide information to help create a learning environ ment where the significance of communication is recognized and appreciated. The study sought to answer this question: What are students' perceptions con cerning their future business communication tasks?"
