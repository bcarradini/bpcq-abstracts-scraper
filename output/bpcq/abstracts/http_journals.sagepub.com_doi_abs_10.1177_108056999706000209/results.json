      "Recent articles in Business Communication Quarterly advocate giving oral feedback on business communication assignments and compare such com mentary to written feedback: Little attention has been paid, however, to computer-assisted feedback. This article describes one way to give such word- processed feedback, describes some advantages of this mode over both hand written and audio comments, and identifies some limitations of this method."
