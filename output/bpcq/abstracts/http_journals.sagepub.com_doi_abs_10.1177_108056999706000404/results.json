      "Since 1994, a course in international business writing has been taught simul taneously at institutions in Belgium, Finland, and the United States. The course, which grew out of earlier, shorter-term activities involving Belgian and U.S. students, has three components: (a) instruction; (b) a simulation, in which students exchange business documents internationally; and (c) case studies of business people who communicate internationally in writing."
