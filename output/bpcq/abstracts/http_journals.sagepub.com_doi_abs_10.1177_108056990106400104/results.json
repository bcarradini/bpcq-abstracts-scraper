      "Instructors who want to improve their teaching often do not know how to identify the changes they need or want to make. This article offers practical suggestions on course planning and class preparation, effective communication, questioning and responding, assessment and evaluation. The focus is on providing a method of observing the process of teaching and learning. If teachers know how to observe themselves, they can more easily establish a personal style that motivates their students."
