      "In fall 2003, students from two U.S. universities and a Canadian university participated in an ethics project. One solution to overcome the obstacles to ethics discussions among students who are geographically separated is the use of email as a mode of communication. As a basis for their discussions, the students used the accounting ethics vignette titled “The Error” from the Ar thur Andersen Business Ethics Program. This ar ticle repor ts on the results of the analysis of U.S. and Canadian students' responses to pre- and postquestionnaires concerning the alternatives available to the character in the ethics scenario before and after their written email discussions and group repor ts. The students did have significant changes in their responses after their discussions of the character's alternatives. It also repor ts the students' responses to a project feedback questionnaire concerning the students' perceptions of the importance of ethical training and discussions."
