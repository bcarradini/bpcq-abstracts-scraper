      "Implementation of total quality management and continu ous process improvement require validation of competencies by an institution's customers. This study was designed to determine if business faculty and business professionals perceive (a) business writing skills, (b) oral/interpersonal skills, (c) basic English skills, and (d) other business com munication abilities with the same degree of importance. Four one-way analyses of variance revealed no significant difference between 35 business professionals and 30 busi ness faculty concerning the four areas. However, when the 50 competencies within the four areas were ranked, some visible differences occurred in using the telephone and intercom, asking questions, and applying confidentiality."
