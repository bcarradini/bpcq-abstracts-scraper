      "Focus groups provide users with valuable qualitative data not readily obtained with any other data-collection techniques. First developed for market researchers to determine the present or potential impact of a product or ser vice, focus groups also help administrators and developers gain information about programs, assess the effectiveness of healthcare and family-planning projects, design political campaigns, and evaluate graduate programs and research efforts, among other data-collection tasks. Business communication classes provide an excellent setting for learning about focus groups and putting such a process into practice."
