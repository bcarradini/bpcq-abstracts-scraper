      "Information literacy is an essential skill for business communication students. Traditionally taught by librarians, there is a pressing need for all business instructors to incorporate informational literacy training into their courses. Moreover, students need to hone their research skills, moving beyond a dependence on Google and Wikipedia. This article describes an assignment that pushes students to be creative and dogged in their research, to think critically about the information they find, and to provide solutions and tools for fellow students for improving their research and critical thinking skills."
