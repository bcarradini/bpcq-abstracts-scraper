      "Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALGains) is a Web-based instrument for measuring student perception of their learning in a variety of courses. The authors adapted this instrument to measure studentsâ€™ achieved proficiency in analyzing cases in an advanced business communication class. The instrument showed that students did achieve a high level of proficiency and that they did so equally in both traditional and online classes."
