      "Following Rogersâ€™s theory of the diffusion of innovations, the author questions whether youth entering the workforce will act as change agents to evolve primary business communication channels from email to text-messaging. Expanding on research performed in 2009, the author investigates three communication scenarios: scheduling meetings, exchanging information in the workplace, and keeping in contact with family and friends. Follow-up research also gathers information about communication hardware trends. The author concludes that change agents and early adopters already in the company, not new hires, will effect a change in communication media that will involve new technology such as smartphones."
