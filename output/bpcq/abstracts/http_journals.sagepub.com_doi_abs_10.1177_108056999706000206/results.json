      "With the heavy reliance upon restcmes for securing employment, instructors are called upon both formally and informally to teach résumé design. The pre sent research was conducted in response to the observation that limited empir ical research exists on résumé content. More specifically, the research extends from and compares to a study of a decade ago (Hutchinson, 1984) to detect potential changes in the preferences for résumé content of personnel adminis trators in Fortune 500 organizations. Based upon responses to questionnaires, the present research draws comparisons between the 1984 research and the present survey to enhance the information available to teachers of résumé design."
