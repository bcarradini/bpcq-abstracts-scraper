      "Today's student populations comprise more minority students, more students for whom English is a second language, and more older students than in the past. These changes prompted this descriptive study in which business faculty members' perceptions about the business commumcation curriculum are examined. Faculty perceive their students to have problems with basic writing skills as well as with sophisticated writing concepts and techniques. Faculty seem to agree on the content that should be included in a business communi cation course. As a result, guidelines are recommended for those who revise the business communication course."
