      "Accounting educators recently have focused increased attention on the role of the formal curriculum in developing writing skills. Prior research results may be of limited use in curriculum development because these studies rely almost exclusively on the testing of accountants. This article argues that the user of accounting information also is an important party in the communication process. Therefore, the user's input should be considered when evaluating the writing skills of accountants."
