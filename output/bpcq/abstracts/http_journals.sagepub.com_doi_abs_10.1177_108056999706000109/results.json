      "As business relationships with China increase, management of multinational enterprises and joint ventures in the U.S. and in China realizes that success depends on attention to cultural differences. This article was written by a Chi nese professor of business communication who benefited from a business internship in San Francisco and an American professor of finance who wit nessed cultural differences in business during a recent exchange visit in Shanghai. The article highlights several cultural differences that promote understanding and reduce the difficulties of dealing with these disparate cul tures. The Chinese point of view of these cultural differences makes this article uniquely valuable."
