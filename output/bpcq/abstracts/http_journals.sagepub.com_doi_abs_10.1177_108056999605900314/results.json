      "Regardless of their oral communication ability, students must be willing to use their communication skills to be successful in business professions. A pro gram of study that addresses communication skills may not satisfactorily address the apprehension students may feel about communicating. In this study we administered the Personal Report of Communication Appreliension (PRCA) to 84 accounting seniors at an institution whose curriculum requires significant communication skills training and practice. We conclude that busi ness educators must pay special attention to communication apprehension separate from, and in addition to, communication skills."
