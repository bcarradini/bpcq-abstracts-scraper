      "Althoteoh researchers have studied extensively the workplace writing of col lege-degreed professionals, less is known about the writing habits of those without such degrees. This study examined the on-the-job writing of one such groupâ€”60 front-line supervisors in a Midwest steel manufacturing plant. Responses to a questionnaire, interviews, and an analysis of 246 documents produced information about the frequency, type, purpose, and length of writ ing produced along with the challenges the supervisors faced as writers on the job. This information will help business communications instructors enhance their understanding of writing on the front line."
