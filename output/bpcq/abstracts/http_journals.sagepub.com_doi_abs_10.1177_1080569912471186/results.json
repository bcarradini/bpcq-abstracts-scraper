      "Specialists in international education maintain that all undergraduates require contact with and understanding of other nations, languages, and cultures to develop intercultural communication skills. To determine if the business school at a small comprehensive university provides sufficient intercultural communication training, feedback from two surveys and an interview with the international business (IB) coordinator were analysed. Results revealed that the business school has implemented a multicomponent IB concentration, but that business language initiatives were unsustainable because of inadequate administrative commitment. Thus, efforts directed at internationalising the curriculum fail unless they are fully integrated into all programs and engage all stakeholders."
