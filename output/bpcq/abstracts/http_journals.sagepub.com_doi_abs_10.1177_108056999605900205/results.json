      "We describe the communication component in a first-year MBA program that has been entirely integrated. In this integrated program, no courses, per se, exist; rather, the year's curriculum is built around stages in the business devel opment cycle. We first consider the choices that a program developer has to make about whether communication instruction will be reguired or elective, with or without credit, in the form of courses or workshops, and independent of or integrated with the rest of a business program. We then describe the com munication program, discuss the challenges of embarking on an integrated project, and suggest strategies for meeting them."
