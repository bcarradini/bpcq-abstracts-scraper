      "This study investigates the combined impact of a memory test and subsequent listening practice in enhancing student listening abilities in collegiate business administration courses. The article reviews relevant literature and describes an exploratory study that was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of this technique with traditional lecture. The inquiry provided evidence of the potential value of memory tests and listening practice as pedagogical tools that promote listening ability."
