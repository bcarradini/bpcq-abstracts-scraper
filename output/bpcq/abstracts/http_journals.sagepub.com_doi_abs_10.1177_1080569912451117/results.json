      "With our core focus on teaching and scholarship, business communication teacher-scholars are well placed to become leaders in the international Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) movement. In this article, SoTL is defined and contextualized, three SoTL research approaches are introduced, and disciplinary research projects are suggested. A SoTL research agenda in business communication can improve our teaching practices, our studentsâ€™ learning, and our disciplinary knowledge in very compelling ways."
