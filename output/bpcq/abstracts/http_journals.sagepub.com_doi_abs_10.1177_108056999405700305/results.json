      "Most introductory-level business writing texts fail to carry page design challenges beyond the chapter that outlines fundamentals. Clearly, if business writing instructors wish to help their students improve as designers, they must go beyond what textbooks offer. They must challenge their students repeatedly throughout the course. Three design challenges that are meant to be presented to stu dents over an eight-to-ten-week period are described."
