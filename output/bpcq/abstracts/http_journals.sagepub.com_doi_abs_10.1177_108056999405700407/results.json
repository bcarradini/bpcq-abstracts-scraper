      "To determine written communication skill requirements, responsibilities, and deficiencies of employees in interna tional businesses, a nationwide survey of key personnel administrators in selected companies was conducted. The findings indicate that (a) major writing responsibilities exist in various departments within international compa nies, (b) the variety of documents produced are similar to those in domestic businesses, (c) most written do cuments are produced at the keyboard or in longhand, and (d) the major writing deficiency is mechanics. Screening tech niques employed to assess writing abilities before hiring individuals most often include a review of the application materials. Most reported that no specific communication problems exist because nearly all business is conducted in English. Yet the representatives who were interviewed had recommendations for ensuring successful international written communications."
