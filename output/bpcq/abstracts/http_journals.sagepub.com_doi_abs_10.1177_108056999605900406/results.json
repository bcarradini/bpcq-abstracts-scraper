      "Writing comments on student papers takes tremendous effort, and this study attempted to determine how students use these comments, the importance of the comments, and methods to encourage students to use comments. The results revealed that students' course grades did not correlate with their use of comments; however, students were likely to review comments if they had to rewrite assignments. Significant differences existed between course grades and these variables: (a) how well students read comments, (b) how useful com ments were, (c) how well students understood comments, and (d) how likely students were to get help in understanding comments."
