      "This study investigates the acceptance of a prototype resume that includes candidate personality assessment information. Data were obtained from hiring managers and human resource professionals in regional chapters of the Society for Human Resource Management. Respondents found the new content useful and that the new information added value when compared with a traditional resume. This study suggests the possibility of improving the effectiveness of candidate screening and selection with the inclusion of such data in a standard resume and may be useful for instructing new business school graduates in the preparation of their professional resumes."
