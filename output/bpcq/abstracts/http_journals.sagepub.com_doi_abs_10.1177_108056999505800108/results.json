      "In order to reproduce the politically charged environment of most corporations, I turn my class into a company. Using previously designated study groups, I make one the presi dent, another the vice president, and a final one the man ager of operations. Then I give them a problem which they can handle only through memos. Outside of class, they communicate by fax machines. Inside of class, they read and discuss each other's memos. This assignment enables the instructor to drop out of the role of lecturer as students discover for themselves the complex interaction between a writer and an audience."
