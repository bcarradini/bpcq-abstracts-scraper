      "Understanding student perceptions of group work should help educators prepare students to be effective group members in the classroom and at work. This study ascer tained student perceptions of their learning and achievement in group situations. The following correlations were determined: (a) There was a relationship between student grades and perceptions of the writing quality as well as perceptions of the amount learned about group processes; (b) there was no correlation between grades and student opinions of the quantity of work achieved, the type of person who hindered the group the most, and whether the student enjoyed the group work."
