      "Cultural-diversity training programs typically incorporate discussions of why some organizational acts and actors are seen as offensive while others are not. Invariably these discussions elicit perceptions and attributions of the actor's intent and interpersonal style. This paper presents a new model, incorporating intent and style into four archetypes. The archetypes are discussed in detail as are implications for designing and conducting cultural-diversity training."
