      "Groupware is a recent development in the on-going search to improve corpo rate communication and decision-making processes. This study examines a classroom application of groupware for computer-supported cooperative work, consisting of problem solving, decision making, and development of group reports. Survey results indicate that student groupware users are generally sat isfied with member contributions and group output but are less satisfied with software-supported, decision-making processes. The study suggests that group ware is a powerful communication tool for support of work groups but that it may not, in itself, solve the basic problems of getting people to work together effectively and productively."
