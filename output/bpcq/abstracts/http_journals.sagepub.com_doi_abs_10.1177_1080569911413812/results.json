The reader can consider a variety of learning objectives from team building to persuasion, application of electronic media to face-to-face communication, and much more. Some Favorite Assignments take a full semester to complete; others can be done within a single class. Each assignment reflects the individual authorâ€™s passion for active learning that stimulates practical skill-building, judgment, and communication skills."
