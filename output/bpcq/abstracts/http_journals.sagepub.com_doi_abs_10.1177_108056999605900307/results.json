      "Practitioners, students, and instructors of business communication can benefit from learning new professional technologies; but choosing among them may be difficult. This article provides a method, based on human factors, for help ing individuals with that choice. The first step is to complete a self-assessment questionnaire ranking preferences among forms, industries, techniques, roles, and purposes for writing. Then, individuals can match those preferences to typ ical expectationsfor each of several new text technologies: structured on-line documentation markups, help screens and interactive tutorials, and multime dia presentations. With that information, individuals can choose training in a technology that suits them."
