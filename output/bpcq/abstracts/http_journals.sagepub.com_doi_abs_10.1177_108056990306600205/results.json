      "Distributed learning theory is valuable for teachers of online business communica tion courses because it 1) highlights complexities of software tools, not only the online course interface, but also tools used to produce Websites, brochures, CDs, and other multi-media elements; 2) provides a way to address online communica tion dynamics, such as online chats and discussions, that students will practice in the workplace; and 3) allows teachers to examine how their previous experiences teaching business communication in more \"traditional\" classrooms affect teaching online. Highlighting these areas allows business communication teachers to focus on the critical use of technology in online formats that entail relatively new teach ing media. The critical application of technology use can be seen in areas like tool evaluation and use, power and divisions of labor, and community participation."
