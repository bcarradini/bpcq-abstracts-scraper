      "This article describes a new course that focuses on the impact of evolving communication technologies on business. Two core questions are addressed in the class: First, how does a manager or employee choose the appropriate channel for a given communication situation? Second, how does an organization choose which technologies are appropriate for its business needs? In the course, we answer those questions by examining strategic models, assessing specific technologies, and presenting case studies. The article discusses these ideas and evaluates the effectiveness of the course."
