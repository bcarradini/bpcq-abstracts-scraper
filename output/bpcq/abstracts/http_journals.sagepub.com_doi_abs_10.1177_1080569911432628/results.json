      "Many people have considered purchasing a tablet device, such as an iPad, Kindle, or Nook, for personal use, yet how many have considered adopting this new technology as a pedagogical tool in the classroom? This article reports on the adoption and use of Kindle eBooks on the campus during the Spring 2010 semester. The authors report on how the eBook supported student learning and course outcomes, and they examine the results of survey assessments of the eBook project. Overall, the university believes that the pilot project conducted proved to be a success, and the campus will continue using tablet devices in the future."
