      "Many business communication teachers are grappling with ways to use the rich potential of the WorldWide Web. A categorization or typology of sites provides students with a tool to explore the Web systematically and attentively. The typology discussed in this article divides corporate sites into five cate gories depending on purpose: marketplace awareness and promotion, cus tomer support, sales, advertising, and electronic information services. Armed with this typology, students analyze sites as examples of business communica tion. Based on this analysis, they develop a collaborative oral presentation."
