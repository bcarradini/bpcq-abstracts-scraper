      "We asked each student enrolled in a graduate-level management communica tion course to describe in wrzting a work-related communication episode that had challenged him or her. Students reported most difficulties in face-to-face oral events, particularly when required to interact with someone in a different organization or with someone who ranked higher in the organization. Students also identified communication-related needs (for example, improved self-confidence and persuasiveness). Our results indicate that graduate management communication courses should include oral communication and should not conceptualize oral communication exclusively in terms of formal presentations."
