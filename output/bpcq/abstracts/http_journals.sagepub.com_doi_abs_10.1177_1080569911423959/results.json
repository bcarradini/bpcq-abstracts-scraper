      "Based on a client project assigned to students in two undergraduate business classes, this article argues that social media learning is best done in a context that mixes social media with more traditional kinds of media. Ideally, this approach will involve teams of students who are working on different aspects of a larger client project. This integrated setup has several benefits: It enhances the studentsâ€™ understanding of social media within a real context, it complements more traditional communication methods, and it reveals the communicative aspects of key business functions."
