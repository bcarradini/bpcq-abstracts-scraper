      "This article focuses on the importance of presenting ethics and communica tion as twin concepts in the management communication class. It underscores the increasing importance and complexity of ethical issues and presents two cases that the instructor can use for analysis and discussion. The cases address two contemporary issuesâ€”harassment in the workplace and the consumption of alcohol by pregnant women. Both have implications for business profes sionals and allow students a chance to analyze their views and make decisions about communication strategies."
