      "This research includes survey data about the types of anxiety levels that college students experience while preparing for job interviews. Survey findings included female students reporting higher levels of anxiety than their male counterparts on four of the five scales. Results suggest that additional training for female applicants could reduce anxiety levels and help them excel in job interviews. Implications for job applicants, academic communities, and recruiters are discussed. The article concludes with study limitations and suggestions for future research."
