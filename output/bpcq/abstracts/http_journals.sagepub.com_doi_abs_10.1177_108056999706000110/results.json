      "This study documents how the literature on group work supports my goals in the business communication classroom and how my experiment with group works proved to be successful. Students were grouped heterogeneously to expe rience the value of working with others and developing intercultural commu nication skills. Student statements and diaries showed that those who were afraid of being exploited or dominated by others in group work discovered the excitement of collaborative learning while exchanging ideas and helping or teaching each other. It was also observed that cultural and demographic differences tended to be eliminated during the interactions."
