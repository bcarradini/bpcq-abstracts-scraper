      "In a recent survey, faculty in the College of Business Administration at Georgia State University recorded their perceptions of the effectiveness of both undergradu ate and graduate student writing. In general, respondents found students were able to design and present their documents well and to analyze and build common ground with the reader. They were less able to select and organize material, pres ent a plan of action, and express their message clearly. In further comments and follow-up discussions, respondents expressed frustration with their lack of time in class to teach both their areas of expertise and effective writing skills.\"Evaluating written assignments is time consuming, labor-intensive work, and our new faculty work load policy will not encourage the use of written assignments. \"\"Writing is a skill that can be taught and we should be doing it. Unfortunately the move to larger class sizes is a disincentive for faculty to assign more written work.\""
