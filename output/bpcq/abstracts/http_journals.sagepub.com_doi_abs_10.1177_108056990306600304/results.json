      "Shared teaching, also known as team teaching, is an innovative way to balance teaching and research. Shared teaching benefits students by providing the perspec tive of two or more professors in one class. Such an approach also benefits profes sors by giving them more concentrated time for their research. A review of the lit erature on the topic and examination of two distinct shared teaching models show that shared teaching has advantages and challenges for both faculty and students and is a viable option for reallocating resources."
