      "As more emphasis is placed on groupwork in business environments, management students need to be aware of the psychological underpinnings of communication. They also benefit from understanding how people learn because they are likely to have to incorporate such understanding when, as managers, they implement orga nizational change. Moreover, they have to become life-long learners themselves as they adapt to new business environments. Business communication classes can perform an important role in preparing students to meet these challenges by intro ducing them to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Kolb's experiential learning cycle."
