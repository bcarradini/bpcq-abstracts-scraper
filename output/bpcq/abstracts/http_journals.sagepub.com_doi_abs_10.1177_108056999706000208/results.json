      "Business communication students at two midwestern universities were polled on the first day of the 1995 spring term to determine their (1) written com naunication assignment likes Idislikes; (2) oral communication assignment likes/dislikes; (3) experience using e-mail; and (4) attitudes toward written, oral, and e-mail communication. The 144 respondents viewed oral communi cation less positively than they did either written or e-mail communication. Significant differences were found among overall ratings for oral, written, and e-mail communication. In addition, students with prior e-mail experience gave significantly higher ratings to it and to oral communication than did those who had not used e-mail."
