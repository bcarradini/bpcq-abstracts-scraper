      "Some instructors undervalue or ignore such short assignments as peer cri tiques, progress memos, and practice documents when they calculate final grades, while others over-emphasize these documents, assigning each a critique and grade, which results in more work for them and re-emphasizes the impor tance of the grade to the student. One strategy for fairly assessing these docu ments is to incorporate them in a performance review at the middle and end of the course. Such a review also helps prepare studerus for the evaluation process they will face and use in the workplace."
