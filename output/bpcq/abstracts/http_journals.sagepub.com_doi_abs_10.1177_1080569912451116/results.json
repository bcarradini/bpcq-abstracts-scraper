      "Poetry recitation removes the distractions of creating and organizing original material so that business students can focus on presentation skills of delivery, confidence, and memory. Delivery includes articulation, emphasis, nonverbals, and presence. Confidence and memory development are complementary. Confidence comes from trusting the memory and memory adds confidence. Memory is treated as a larger skill for business, not as a crutch for presenting. Rationale, resources, implementation and evaluation for this assignment are all detailed."
